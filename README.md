**Hack-The-Terminal** is a retro-style terminal-based hacking game where you play as a digital intruder trying to crack into a fictional server... using only your brain 🧠 and basic math 🧮.

Dive into the green terminal, solve math puzzles, and outsmart the system before time runs out. The deeper you go, the harder it gets. Are you fast enough to **hack the terminal**?
